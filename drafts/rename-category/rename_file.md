That's because we append a `-` and a number to the end of each post link.
So for this post, the real path would be like `your-domain.com/this-is-an-example-post-1472`.

Visiting a stale URL will be redirected to the fresh URL with status 301.

## How to add pictures to your posts?

Remember to put the images in the [/images](/images) directory. The blog **cannot** recognize other directories as image directory!

For referencing an image, it is completely Markdown syntax.

![](/images/example_1.jpg 'A Little Penguin')

## What are the best practices for using markdown?

Please read [Markdown Guide ](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/basic-syntax/).
